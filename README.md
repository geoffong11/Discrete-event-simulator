# Discrete-event-simulator

Overview
This project is a discrete event simulator implemented in Java. It models the behavior of a system by simulating individual events occurring at specific points in time. The goal of this simulator is to provide a framework for understanding and analyzing systems that evolve over time through discrete events.

## Usage
1) Clone this repository to your local machine.
2) Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3) Explore and modify the Event, EventHandler, and Simulator classes to define your simulation scenario.
4) Run the Main class to start the simulation.
5) User input starts with values representing the number of servers, the number of self-check counters, the maximum queue length and the probability of a server resting. This is followed by the arrival times of the customers. Lastly, a number of service times (could be more than necessary) are provided.
6) Observe the console output to see how events are processed and the simulation progresses.
## Implementation Details
The discrete event simulator is implemented using object-oriented principles and the Java programming language.

## Skills learned
During the development of this project, the following skills were learned and reinforced:

1) Object-oriented programming principles.
2) Java language features and syntax.
3) Priority queues and data structures for event management.
4) Simulation techniques and the concept of discrete event simulation.
5) Modelling and simulating systems using events and event handlers.
6) Debugging and troubleshooting complex systems.
